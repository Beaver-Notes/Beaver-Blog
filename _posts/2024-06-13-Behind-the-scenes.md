A lot has been going on behind the scenes at Beaver. Our community has grown significantly, as have our projects. In this packed blog post, we will guide you through what we have accomplished over the past few days, weeks, and even months. <!--more-->  

## New Blog and Docs

Let’s start with [our blog](https://beaver-notes.github.io/Beaver-Blog/). As you can see, it has received a huge makeover using Jekyll at its core. Beaver Blog is now easier to maintain and deploy thanks to its markdown nature, which also makes contributions easier.

Next, [our documentation](https://beaver-notes.github.io/Beaver-Docs) has also received a complete makeover. We switched from Gitbook to Docusaurus, which, like our blog, uses markdown and a simple folder structure. It can also be deployed on GitHub Pages, which means no hosting fees, allowing us to allocate funds to developing our apps and services. While we were at it, we rewrote our docs to update and correct them.

## GitHub

In more recent updates, Beaver Notes now has its own GitHub organization. This provides the project with more credibility, makes it easier for contributors to integrate into the community, and allows us to store all projects in one place.

## Translations

Translations are also a key part of our project. Since our switch to Traduora, Beaver Notes has seen three new language additions: Spanish, Ukrainian, and Dutch. More languages, like Russian, are in the works. We thank our community for their contributions in making Beaver even more accessible.

## Beaver Notes

Beaver Notes has matured significantly since version 2.x. Thanks to the community’s feedback and dedication, we have introduced features such as embedded videos and files, allowing you to store everything in one place, thereby improving productivity and convenience. It is also thanks to this feedback that we continue to provide new features and improve existing ones.

### What's Coming in Version 3.3.0

**Beaver Notes 3.3.0** will feature an improved code block with an option to copy the content of the block and a new mermaid block that allows users to create pie charts, sequence diagrams, flowcharts, and more. Our major breakthrough, however, is integrations. Third-party apps will be able to create and delete notes and labels. These apps will need to ask permission from the user, who will decide what the app can access and will be able to revoke or disable access at any time.

### A Playground for Devs

To ensure developers can better integrate their apps with Beaver Notes, we created the [Beaver API Playground.](https://github.com/Beaver-Notes/Beaver-API-playground) This playground guides developers in using the API and offers a pre-made codebase to consult whenever needed.

This opens up the field to automations, web clippers, and extensions, enabling users to take full advantage of Beaver’s open-source and community-based nature, making the possibilities endless.

## Beaver Pocket

We are near the finish line for the development of Beaver Pocket, which we expect to debut on the App Store, Play Store, and F-Droid by the end of July, if not sooner. With Beaver Pocket, we managed to pack all the features of Beaver Notes into a sleek mobile app while maintaining our high privacy standards by storing everything on the device.

### What Have We Been Up To Lately

In recent weeks, we have introduced cloud sync with WebDAV and Nextcloud, with more platforms to come. We've also improved the interface and incorporated features from Beaver Notes, like the mermaid block to create and edit diagrams, flowcharts, and more, the new code block, math block, video, file block, note linking, and many more features we are sure you will love.

To conclude, even though we have been silent for a while, we have managed to tear down some walls, providing our users with better documentation, a more up-to-date blog, and improved applications and experiences for both users and contributors. We thank you for your support and love for all that we do and love doing.
